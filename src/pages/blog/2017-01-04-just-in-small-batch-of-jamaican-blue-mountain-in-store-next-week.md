  We call it spring semester, or just “spring”, even though it’s pretty much
  winter in Utah until May. As I mentioned in a previous post, spring semester
  begins in January and that’s when we begin spring soccer. That first spring
  semester I had my first taste of what the real nitty gritty side of college
  soccer is. The fall previous we had taken 9th place in the PAC 12, one of our
  worst finishes to date. So, the way that the coaches and staff decided to
  change our path was to work us into the ground. I’m not really even
  exaggerating when I say that, they kicked our butts day in and day out. In our
  last team meeting of the fall, after the seniors had left, Rich told us that
  if we weren’t willing to work hard and cry, bleed and sweat to get to where we
  wanted to go, then we didn’t have any business on the team. He wasn’t joking.

Our fitness consisted (and still consists) of these fun things called 15-second runs, or VO2 max runs as Cody likes to call them. The idea is that every person has their own distance that they run based on their own personal fitness level, rather than a “one size fits all” approach. So there were people like Janie who ran close to 40 yards down and back in 15 seconds, while people who were not as fit would run closer to 30 yards down and back. You work for 15 seconds, then have 10 yards to walk in 15 seconds as your rest time, and then you go again. Our first week we started out running for 4 minutes, which meant 8 runs. Then you get a 3-minute rest and go again. Each week we would run those on Tuesdays and Fridays and then the next week we would increase by two minutes. So the next week was 6 minutes (12 sprints), then 8 minutes (16 sprints), then 10 minutes (20 sprints), then we max out at 12 minutes (24 sprints) and we always do two sets. They are easily the hardest fitness I’ve ever had to do, no joke. My teammates would have to do this kind of fitness before or after a super hard practice, while I would sometimes have to run before or after more fitness since that’s all I could do. It was incredibly challenging in all aspects of the word.

 I think what I was also struggling with, though, was my identity. It might sound crazy to people who don’t play sports or who haven’t had something consume their lives like sports do, but my identity was rooted in soccer. I didn’t know who I was without it and since I couldn’t fully play, I didn’t know who I was anymore. I did a lot of soul searching and talking with my parents and praying, but it wasn’t until one day in institute when I really came to terms with my situation and realized what this was supposed to teach me. We were discussing a talk given during October 2015 conference (I couldn’t tell you which one off the top of my head) and a specific quote came up: “When you cannot do what you have always done, you only do what matters most.” This seriously almost slapped me in the face. What mattered most to me? Obviously, soccer is important to me, but is it really what matters most? That’s when everything started to turn around. I tried to make the Savior and the gospel the center of my life. I strived to serve those around me. I reached out to girls that I didn’t even know who I had heard tore their ACL and tried to give them words of encouragement and advice. I realized that this was the reason that this injury happened – it was to refocus my life and to help others who experience the same thing.

Now, just because I figured that out doesn’t mean that spring got any easier. It still was probably the hardest thing I have ever completed in my life. The frustration of being so close to playing but not quite cleared was also a factor in how hard it was on me. I just wanted to play soccer again SO BADLY, and I wasn’t being very patient. I had to watch my team play games without me and that was so hard. Luckily, Tom kept me focused and grounded and wouldn’t let me push myself beyond what I should have. I’m forever thankful for his patience and care for me.

 Somehow, spring season came to an end when it felt like it never would. We had about a week to get moved out of the dorms and get ready to go to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for our team international trip!! We were all so excited and I was looking forward to potentially playing in the games during that trip.
